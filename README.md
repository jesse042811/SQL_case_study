# SQL_case_study
Tables given with ID, Datetime, metricName, and metricValue, but want to repivot in a manner where we can focus on specific metricName and tracks which versions they used based on the metricValue column.

I've posted by solution in `finalSQL.sql`. Feel free to leave a comment on how I can improve the solution

## Requirements/Information

**Convert a table of metrics into a Version history table**

- We need to convert the contents of the `data.csv` file into the contents of the `finalData.csv` file
- Version1 is a major software update
- Version2 is a minor software update

**Desired Final Format**
| clientID | dateTime   | Version1 | Version2 |
|----------|------------|----------|----------|
| A        | 2021-01-01 | 1.0      | A1       |
| A        | 2021-01-02 | 1.0      | A2       |
| B        | 2022-01-01 | 3.0      | A4       |

**Must use SQL to keep as much processing in one system as possible**

- This would be easier in Python or R but then we’d have to extract the data from the database, transform it, then reimport it

**For each deviceID, there’s only a record when there’s an update to the system**

**If we just pivot our records then we get a lot of nulls**

## Resources

The initial data is in `data.csv`

You can insert the data into https://sqliteonline.com/ for a quick and easy SQL Database


## What You'll Learn / Use

My solution uses:
* The `PIVOT` operator
* `WITH` to create a Continuous Table Expression (CTE)
* `OVER` to use window functions
